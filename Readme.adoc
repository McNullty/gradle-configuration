= Gradle Configuration example

This project is to test out gradle configurations in controlled and simple way.

== Jacoco

Jacoco reports will generate reports before check task. Three reports will be generated.
One for unit tests, one for integration tests and one for combined unit and integration tests.

== Jacoco coverage verification

Code coverage can be verified with:
`./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification`

It will fail if code coverage for all tests (integration and unit) is below 80%.

== AsciiDoctor + RestDocs

Running integrationTest task will generate asciiDoctor snippets to build/generated-snippets directory.

== PITest

You can run mutation test with `./gradlew pitest`
